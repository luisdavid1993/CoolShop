CoolShop Desing Pattern

 
## Domain driven development 
Follow the vocabulary of you end user (ubiquitous language)
## Factory Method
The Factory Method defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which classes to instantiate
## Mediator Pattern
Handle all the communication between difference components.
## Strategy Pattern, Behavioral pattern
This is a behavioral pattern witch help to select algorithms on runtime. It chooses algorithms dynamically.
## Repository
It creates a commons interface, a common base point for creating a differences type of concrete data access methods.
## Adapter Pattern
Helps to work in a unified way when we have incompatible interfaces from tree party. For example, we retrieved data in Json and xml format but we mapped this both  types into a common object.
## Lazy Loading 
Load static information just ones. 
## Rip 
Replacing If condition with polymorphism 
## Simple factory, Creational Pattern
Create a new object in a difference class.
## IOC, Inversion of Control
Solid Principle, take this unnecessary logic for this class and put it in another place. 
## Unit of work 
Solve the problems of repository pattern, create a single transaction for difference repositories
## Decorator 
Adding behavior by using separate class
##  Iterator Pattern
When just need to iterate over a list, do not allow add, remove end other method, just iterate. Enumerable or Enumerator encapsulate ADD, REMOVE methods.
## Prototype
Create a new copy of the object (Clone an object)
## Memento
To reverse back to any old estate of one object
